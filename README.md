# Matlab_Exponential_Growth_GUI
This code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) in MATLAB that allows a user to run a Logistic Growth Simulation allowing the user to define starting population size, percent noise, growth rate, and time step; to observe the effects of each biologically.

My code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows a user to study George Stephenson’s experiment in cell growth. The user can input the starting number of cells, the growth rate, the time step, and the percent noise they would like to add to the data. The code then calculates the time it takes to achieve six doublings, plots the cell count versus time, plots the final cell count versus the starting number, plots an overlay of the noisy simulated data and the modeled data, and plots the final cell count versus the starting number and number of doublings.

The experiment is based on a classical biological experiment in which Stephenson attempted to measure the rate of cell growth in a culture of bacteria. By studying the growth of a bacterial culture, researchers are able to gain insight into the dynamics of population growth. This experiment can be used to study the growth of other populations, such as those of plants and animals.

By studying the dynamics of population growth, researchers can gain insight into the factors that influence the growth of a population. This can be useful in understanding the impacts of environmental factors, such as temperature and water availability, on population growth. It can also help to inform conservation efforts, as understanding the impacts of environmental factors on population growth can help inform efforts to protect and restore populations.

By studying the dynamics of population growth, researchers can also gain insight into the effects of population size on the rate of growth. For example, by studying the growth of bacterial cultures, researchers can gain insight into how population size affects the rate of growth. This can be useful for understanding how population size affects the spread of disease, as well as for understanding how population size affects the rate of evolution.

In addition to providing insight into population growth and the dynamics of population size, this experiment can also be used to study the effects of noise on population growth. By adding noise, researchers can gain insight into how random fluctuations can affect the rate of growth. This can be useful for understanding how random fluctuations can affect the spread of disease, as well as for understanding how random fluctuations can affect the rate of evolution.

Overall, this code allows a user to study George Stephenson’s experiment in cell growth, and can be used to gain insight into the dynamics of population growth, the effects of population size on the rate of growth, and the effects of noise on population growth. This code can be used to inform conservation efforts, to understand the spread of disease, and to understand the rate of evolution.
